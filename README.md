## 🧐 **About This Repository**
This repository is a collection of Python practice files, scripts, and mini-projects that I create while learning and experimenting with Python. The files here may range from simple exercises to more advanced concepts as I progress. Each file reflects a concept, a coding challenge, or an exploration of a Python module.

### **What's Inside?**
- **Concept Explanations**: Learn with me as I break down key Python concepts.
- **Practice Scripts**: Hands-on practice files focusing on individual concepts.
- **Mini Projects**: Small but meaningful projects that apply multiple concepts at once.
- **Problem-Solving**: Solutions to coding challenges and exercises.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.x**: The main programming language for all files.
- **VS Code**: The primary code editor used for writing, debugging, and managing scripts.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and sharing my progress with the world.
